# DTSA5511-final-project

This project uses the [Amazon Product Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arhamrumi/amazon-product-reviews) dataset from Kaggle.

For my final project, I want to look deeper into natural language processing. Even though we explored a natural language project earlier in this course, I wanted to improve my NLP work and look into more state of the art models.

- Revise some of the data cleaning operations performed on full text data that I performed in the disaster tweets mini-project
- Extend the classifier with more labels
- Investigate a transformer model, BERT, and compare it to the RNN model, LSTM
- Lastly, I wanted to compare these deep learning models to a traditional machine learning model, SVM
